### Data Analytics Python Capstone Project

The notebook here is the framework for a project completed to demonstrate knowledge in python. Initial analysis was conducted to organize the data 
for evaluation of hate crimes in the United States from 1991-2020. This project goal was to create functions that would pull categorical data for
future use in exploring issues and trends at the state level for hate crime reporting.
